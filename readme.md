# restaurant-core

A demo restaurant app

## Notes 

* There's so many source files and I'm not sure what they all do- documentation is hard because I'm still unfamiliar with what everything's doing.
* I'm not sure how to distribute this so it can be set up on a new machine.
* There's a lot of security vulnerabilities, with it being very easy for anyone to set up a script to overload whatever machine is hosting this. This is just a demo site, though, so I"m not too concerned.
