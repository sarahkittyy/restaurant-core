# restaurant-core

A demo restaurant app

## Notes 

* There's a lot of security vulnerabilities, with it being very easy for anyone to set up a script to overload whatever machine is hosting this. This is just a demo site, though, so I"m not too concerned.

## Features

* Upload restaurants
* View restaurant details
* Restaurant submission validation
* Inconsistent curly-brace styling
* DB Seeders

## TODO

* Sorting restaurants on the main page
* Reviews
